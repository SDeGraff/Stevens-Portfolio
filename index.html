            <p>Here is where I put the information about me.</p>
 <pre>
 Now this is the story all about how,
 My life got flipped-turned upside down,
 And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right 
 there,I'll tell you how I became the prince of 
 a town called Bel Air
                
 In West Philadelphia, born and raised
 On the playground is where I spent most of my days.
 Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin all cool,
 And all shootin' some B-ball outside of the school.
                
 When a couple of guys who were up to no good,
 Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood.
 I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
 And said "You're movin' with your auntie and 
 uncle in Bel Air."
                
 I whistled for a cab, and when it came near,
 The license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in 
 the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab 
 was rare, But I thought "Nah forget it, Yo home to
 Bel Air."
                
 I pulled up to the house about seven or eight,
 and I yelled to the cabby "Yo homes, smell ya later."
 Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,
 To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
